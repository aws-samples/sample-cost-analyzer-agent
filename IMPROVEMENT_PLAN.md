# sample-cost-analyzer-agent Improvement Plan

Improvements identified by comparing with `sample-finops-agent`. Each item includes what to adopt, where it lives in the finops agent, where to apply it in the cost-analyzer, and estimated effort.

---

## 1. DDL/DML Blocking for Athena Queries

**Priority:** P0 — Security  
**Effort:** ~30 minutes  
**Source:** `sample-finops-agent/src/lambda/mcp_servers/athena/lambda_function.py` lines 56-60

### Problem

The cost-analyzer's `execute_cur_athena_query` and `execute_vpc_flowlog_query` tools rely solely on IAM permissions to prevent destructive SQL operations. If IAM is misconfigured or overly permissive, there's no application-level defense.

### What to adopt

The finops-agent blocks DDL/DML at the application layer before queries reach Athena:

```python
BLOCKED_SQL_PATTERNS = re.compile(
    r"\b(DROP|DELETE|INSERT|UPDATE|CREATE|ALTER|TRUNCATE|MERGE|GRANT|REVOKE|MSCK)\b",
    re.IGNORECASE,
)

def validate_query(query_string):
    if BLOCKED_SQL_PATTERNS.search(query_string):
        return False, "Only SELECT, SHOW, and DESCRIBE queries are allowed."
    return True, None
```

### Where to apply

- `agent/tools/athena_tools.py` — Add validation at the top of `execute_cur_athena_query` and `execute_vpc_flowlog_query` before calling `athena_service.execute_query()`
- Optionally also add to `agent/services/athena_service.py` in the `execute_query` method as a second layer

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Queries containing DDL/DML keywords are rejected before reaching Athena
- [ ] Error message clearly states only SELECT/SHOW/DESCRIBE are allowed
- [ ] Existing SELECT queries continue to work unchanged
- [ ] Unit tests cover blocked patterns (DROP TABLE, DELETE FROM, INSERT INTO, etc.)

## 2. RAGAS Evaluation Framework

**Priority:** P0 — Quality  
**Effort:** 1-2 days  
**Source:** `sample-finops-agent/tests/` (entire directory)

### Problem

The cost-analyzer uses Hypothesis for property-based testing of individual tool functions, but has no evaluation framework for agent-level behavior: Does the agent pick the right tool? Does it use correct parameters? Does it handle edge cases gracefully?

### What to adopt

The finops-agent has a 3-tier evaluation framework:

**Tier 1 — Deterministic (no LLM needed)**
- `test_tool_call_accuracy.py`: Verifies the correct tool is called with correct args
- `test_tool_call_f1.py`: Precision/recall for multi-tool scenarios (flexible ordering)

**Tier 2 — LLM-as-judge**
- `test_agent_goal.py`: Uses RAGAS `AgentGoalAccuracy` for semantic correctness
- Custom `AspectCritic` metrics in `tests/helpers/finops_metrics.py`:
  - Date Range Correctness — validates YYYY-MM-01 start dates, exclusive end dates
  - Tool Selection Efficiency — right tool for the job (e.g., `get_cost_and_usage` vs `get_cost_and_usage_comparisons`)
  - Parameter Completeness — group_by when asked for breakdown, correct granularity
  - Cost Analysis Quality — rubric-scored overall quality

**Tier 3 — Ground truth differential**
- `test_ground_truth.py`: Compares MCP tool results against direct boto3 API calls
- `tests/helpers/comparators.py`: Normalizes response formats, float tolerance matching ($0.01)

**Scenario definitions:**
- `tests/scenarios/cost_explorer.py`: 12 scenarios (CE-1 through CE-12)
- `tests/scenarios/athena.py`: 8 scenarios (ATH-1 through ATH-8)
- Each scenario is an `EvalScenario` dataclass with `id`, `user_input`, `target`, `reference_tool_calls`, `metric_type`, and optional `ground_truth_fn`

### Where to apply

Create a new `tests/evals/` directory in the cost-analyzer:

```
tests/
├── evals/
│   ├── conftest.py                  # Agent client fixture
│   ├── scenarios/
│   │   ├── billing_tools.py         # Scenarios for 43 billing tools
│   │   ├── athena_tools.py          # Scenarios for CUR/VPC queries
│   │   └── analysis_tools.py        # Scenarios for analysis helpers
│   ├── helpers/
│   │   ├── agent_client.py          # Client that invokes the Strands agent
│   │   ├── comparators.py           # Adapt from finops-agent
│   │   └── finops_metrics.py        # Adapt AspectCritic metrics
│   ├── test_tool_selection.py       # Tier 1: deterministic
│   ├── test_agent_quality.py        # Tier 2: LLM-as-judge
│   └── test_ground_truth.py         # Tier 3: differential
├── unit/                            # Existing Hypothesis tests
```

### Key adaptation notes

- The cost-analyzer invokes tools directly via Strands SDK, not through an MCP Gateway. The `agent_client.py` wrapper should call the agent's `__call__` method and capture tool invocations from the response.
- The cost-analyzer has 43 billing API tools + 8 specialized tools vs 17 in the finops-agent. Start with scenarios for the most-used tools: `get_cost_and_usage`, `get_cost_forecast`, `get_savings_plans_purchase_recommendation`, `execute_cur_athena_query`.
- Add a `make test-evals` target to the project.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] At least 20 eval scenarios covering billing, Athena, and analysis tools
- [ ] Deterministic tests pass without LLM calls
- [ ] LLM-as-judge tests run with configurable evaluator model
- [ ] Ground truth tests compare agent output against direct boto3 calls
- [ ] `make test-evals` runs the full suite

## 3. Batch CUR Analysis Tool

**Priority:** P1 — Performance  
**Effort:** 1 day  
**Source:** `sample-finops-agent/src/lambda/mcp_servers/cur_analyst/lambda_function.py`

### Problem

When a user asks "give me a comprehensive cost report," the cost-analyzer's LLM must orchestrate 10-20 sequential tool calls (Cost Explorer queries, Athena queries, savings plan checks). This consumes tokens, adds latency, and risks the LLM losing context mid-analysis.

### What to adopt

The finops-agent's `analyze_cur` tool executes a complete analysis in a single tool call:

1. **Phase 1a** — 5 Cost Explorer API queries (monthly trends by account, by service, current month breakdowns)
2. **Phase 1b** — 5 Savings/RI queries (SP coverage, SP utilization, RI coverage, RI utilization, forecast)
3. **Phase 2** — 10 CUR Athena queries submitted in parallel (monthly totals, service by account, top services, region breakdown, charge types, daily trend, usage types, purchase options, RI/SP savings, instance types)
4. **Post-processing** — Aggregates and truncates results to fit response size limits

### Where to apply

- Create `agent/tools/report_tools.py` with a `generate_comprehensive_report` tool
- Adapt the query templates from the finops-agent's `HISTORICAL_QUERIES` and `DETAILED_QUERIES` dicts
- Use the cost-analyzer's existing `ConcurrentToolExecutor` for parallel Athena query submission
- Add `postprocess_results()`, `aggregate_cost_explorer()`, `aggregate_savings()`, and `limit_cur_rows()` from the finops-agent

### Key adaptation notes

- The cost-analyzer already has `multi_account_executor.py` for parallel execution — reuse it
- The finops-agent hardcodes CUR column names (`unblended_cost`, `amortized_cost`, etc.) which are CUR 2.0 specific. Verify these match the cost-analyzer's CUR schema expectations.
- The finops-agent's `postprocess_results` limits CUR rows to 30 per query. The cost-analyzer streams responses, so the limit can be higher, but keeping results concise helps the LLM produce better analysis.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Single tool call produces a comprehensive cost report
- [ ] Cost Explorer, Savings/RI, and CUR Athena data are all included
- [ ] Athena queries run in parallel (not sequential)
- [ ] Results are post-processed to a reasonable size for LLM consumption
- [ ] Tool works with multi-account configurations
- [ ] Month parameters default to current/previous month when not specified

## 4. Config Content Validation at Load Time

**Priority:** P2 — Reliability  
**Effort:** ~1 hour  
**Source:** `sample-finops-agent/src/lambda/mcp_servers/cur_analyst/lambda_function.py` lines 57-63

### Problem

The cost-analyzer validates config file integrity (SHA-256 hash) but doesn't validate the content format. A config with `database: "my;database"` or `output_location: "not-an-s3-path"` would pass integrity checks but fail at runtime with confusing errors.

### What to adopt

The finops-agent validates config values at module load:

```python
_IDENTIFIER_PATTERN = re.compile(r"^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$")
for _key in ("database", "table"):
    if not _IDENTIFIER_PATTERN.match(CUR_CONFIG[_key]):
        raise ValueError(f"CUR_CONFIG[{_key}] contains invalid characters: {CUR_CONFIG[_key]}")
if not CUR_CONFIG["output_location"].startswith("s3://"):
    raise ValueError(f"CUR_CONFIG[output_location] must start with s3://")
```

### Where to apply

- `agent/services/config_service.py` — Add a `_validate_content()` method called after `_load_config()`
- Validate: AWS account IDs (12-digit numeric), region format, database/table identifiers, S3 paths, role ARN format

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Invalid account IDs, regions, database names, or S3 paths raise clear errors at startup
- [ ] Validation runs before any AWS API calls
- [ ] Error messages identify the specific invalid field and expected format

## 5. Structured Test Scenarios with EvalScenario Dataclass

**Priority:** P2 — Maintainability  
**Effort:** 2-3 hours  
**Source:** `sample-finops-agent/tests/scenarios/cost_explorer.py`

### Problem

Test scenarios are currently embedded in test functions. Adding new scenarios requires writing new test methods. There's no central registry of "what questions should the agent handle well."

### What to adopt

The finops-agent's `EvalScenario` dataclass pattern:

```python
@dataclass
class EvalScenario:
    id: str                          # e.g., "CE-1"
    user_input: str                  # Natural language question
    target: str                      # Tool category
    reference_tool_calls: list[dict] # Expected tool name + args
    metric_type: str                 # deterministic | llm_judge | ground_truth
    ground_truth_fn: str | None      # Direct API function for differential testing
    ground_truth_args: dict          # Args for ground truth function
    notes: str                       # Implementation notes
```

Scenarios are defined as module-level lists and consumed by parametrized pytest tests. Adding a new scenario is a single dataclass entry — no new test code needed.

### Where to apply

- Create `tests/evals/scenarios/` with scenario files per tool category
- Use `@pytest.mark.parametrize` to iterate over scenarios
- This is a prerequisite for Improvement #2 (RAGAS framework)

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] All eval scenarios defined as `EvalScenario` instances
- [ ] Scenarios are parametrized in pytest (one test method, many scenarios)
- [ ] Adding a new scenario requires only a new dataclass entry

## 6. Makefile with Eval Targets

**Priority:** P2 — Developer experience  
**Effort:** 1-2 hours  
**Source:** `sample-finops-agent/Makefile`

### Problem

The cost-analyzer uses `deploy.sh` and `cli.sh` scripts. There's no unified command interface for common development tasks like running evals, linting, or deploying.

### What to adopt

Key targets from the finops-agent's Makefile:

```makefile
test-evals:        ## Run RAGAS agentic evals
test-ground-truth: ## Run differential ground truth tests
test-all-evals:    ## Run all evals
ruff-check:        ## Check Python code with ruff
ruff-format:       ## Format Python code with ruff
check:             ## Run all checks (lint + format + validate)
deploy:            ## Full deploy (apply + update schemas)
```

### Where to apply

- Create `Makefile` in the cost-analyzer project root
- Include targets for: `deploy`, `test`, `test-evals`, `test-ground-truth`, `lint`, `format`, `check`, `clean`
- Keep existing `deploy.sh` and `cli.sh` as the underlying implementations

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `make deploy` runs the full deployment
- [ ] `make test` runs unit tests
- [ ] `make test-evals` runs evaluation suite
- [ ] `make check` runs all linting and validation
- [ ] `make help` shows available targets

## 7. Response Size Post-Processing

**Priority:** P3 — Token efficiency  
**Effort:** 3-4 hours  
**Source:** `sample-finops-agent/src/lambda/mcp_servers/cur_analyst/lambda_function.py` (postprocess_results, aggregate_cost_explorer, aggregate_savings, limit_cur_rows)

### Problem

When the cost-analyzer's tools return large Cost Explorer or Athena results, the full response goes into the LLM context. This wastes tokens and can degrade analysis quality when the LLM is overwhelmed with data.

### What to adopt

The finops-agent's post-processing pipeline:

- `aggregate_cost_explorer()` — Simplifies CE response structure, keeps top 20 items per month for trends, top 30 for current month
- `aggregate_savings()` — Extracts monthly coverage/utilization percentages from nested structures
- `limit_cur_rows()` — Caps Athena results at 30 rows with a truncation note

### Where to apply

- `agent/tools/billing_tools.py` — Add result truncation to tools that return large datasets (e.g., `get_cost_and_usage` with DAILY granularity)
- `agent/tools/athena_tools.py` — Add row limits to CUR and VPC Flow Log query results
- Create `agent/tools/result_utils.py` for shared post-processing functions

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Cost Explorer results are capped at configurable row limits
- [ ] Athena results include a truncation note when rows are dropped
- [ ] Trend data retains time-series structure but limits items per period
- [ ] Existing tool behavior unchanged for small result sets

## Summary

| # | Improvement | Priority | Effort | Impact |
|---|-------------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | DDL/DML Blocking | P0 | 30 min | Security defense-in-depth |
| 2 | RAGAS Eval Framework | P0 | 1-2 days | Agent quality assurance |
| 3 | Batch CUR Analysis Tool | P1 | 1 day | Latency and token cost reduction |
| 4 | Config Content Validation | P2 | 1 hour | Fail-fast on misconfig |
| 5 | EvalScenario Dataclass | P2 | 2-3 hours | Test maintainability (prereq for #2) |
| 6 | Makefile with Eval Targets | P2 | 1-2 hours | Developer experience |
| 7 | Response Size Post-Processing | P3 | 3-4 hours | Token efficiency |

**Recommended execution order:** 1 → 4 → 5 → 2 → 6 → 3 → 7

Items 1 and 4 are quick wins. Item 5 is a prerequisite for item 2. Item 6 ties the eval workflow together. Items 3 and 7 are performance optimizations that can be done independently.
